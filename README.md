## 📋 Report Categories

### 1️⃣ Attendance & Access Management (Daily / Monthly / Yearly)
- Student attendance tracking
- Teacher & staff check-in / check-out reports
- Late arrival monitoring
- Student tardiness management enhancements

---

### 2️⃣ School Health & Disease Management (e.g., COVID)
- Vaccination status reporting
  - Vaccinated or not
  - Vaccination dates
- Facility-based exposure tracking
  - Logs all facilities used by infected individuals
- Aggregated statistics by:
  - School
  - District

- Data aggregation by:
  - Individual school
  - Entire district
- **Role-based visibility**
  - School users → Access only their school data
  - District officials → Access all schools data

---

## 🔐 Authorization & Access Control
- Permission logic enforced at API level
- Embedded QuickSight dashboards respect user scope
- Supports multi-tenant educational environments

---

## 💰 Cost Optimization (Important)
- QuickSight charges **$0.50 per session**
- Implemented a **session caching system**
- Reduced redundant session creation
- Significantly lowered reporting costs
