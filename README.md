<summary><strong>📈 System Scale</strong></summary>

## Data Volume

- 5 years of incident data (since COVID period)
- Hundreds of thousands of records
- Each incident contains:
  - Unique Incident ID
  - Type (Positive / Suspected / Negative)
  - User Information
  - Vaccination Status
  - Site / Facility
  - CreatedAt Timestamp
  - Operational metadata

## Usage & Traffic

- Daily traffic: Thousands ~ Tens of thousands report views
- Average response time: ~3 seconds
- Total reports: ~30
- Visualization types: ~10 (Table, Insight, Graph, KPI, Tabs)
- Users:
  - ~2,000 schools
  - Thousands of administrative staff

<summary><strong>📊 Report Categories</strong></summary>

## 1️⃣ Attendance & Access Management
- Student attendance tracking
- Staff check-in / check-out logs
- Late arrival monitoring
- Tardiness analytics

## 2️⃣ School Health & Disease Monitoring
- Vaccination reporting
- Infection tracking
- Facility exposure logging
- Aggregation by school, district, date range

## 3️⃣ District & School-Level Summary Reports
- Graph-based dashboards
- Aggregated statistics
- Role-based visibility:
  - School users → Access only their school
  - District users → Access all schools

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🧠 Data Modeling Strategy</strong></summary>

## Complex Logic
- Implemented as **Database Views in RDS**
- Reduces dataset complexity
- Improves QuickSight performance

## Simple Calculations
- Implemented using QuickSight Calculated Fields

## Custom SQL Instead of DAX
- Heavy aggregation handled at DB layer
- Visualization layer kept lightweight

<details>
<summary><strong>⚡ Performance Optimization</strong></summary>

## 1️⃣ District-Level Heavy Reports

### Problem
- Aggregation across all schools
- Thousands of school metadata reads
- Expensive RDS joins

### Solution
- Isolated school metadata in DynamoDB
- Implemented RDS ↔ DynamoDB sync logic
- Reports fetch school metadata from DynamoDB

### Result
- Reduced RDS join cost
- Improved district-level performance

---

## 2️⃣ Daily Report Optimization (SPICE)

### Characteristics
- Not real-time
- Daily summary of previous day's incidents

### Solution
- Load dataset into SPICE
- Schedule daily refresh
- Disable direct query

### Result
- Eliminated real-time DB pressure
- Stable performance

---

## 3️⃣ Database-Level Tuning

- Index optimization
- Execution plan analysis
- Join restructuring
- View-based modeling
- Query cost reduction

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔐 Embedded Reporting Flow & Multi-Tenant Design</strong></summary>

## Embedded Reporting Flow

1. Reports created in QuickSight
2. Dashboards embedded via Iframe
3. .NET API + Lambda generate secure embed URLs
4. Role-based permission enforced
5. Multi-tenant isolation maintained

## Authorization & Multi-Tenant Design

- API-level permission enforcement
- Parameter-based filtering
- School-level & District-level scope separation
- Secure embedded access

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>💰 Cost Optimization Strategy</strong></summary>

## Problem

QuickSight charges:
- **$0.50 per session**

With tens of thousands of daily opens:
- Potential cost: Thousands of dollars per day
