## Report Generation Strategy

### Data Modeling
- **Complex Joins**
  - Implemented as **Database Views** in AWS RDS
  - Improves performance and simplifies QuickSight datasets

- **Simple Transformations**
  - Handled using **QuickSight Calculated Fields**
  - Enables flexible, temporary column creation

### Report Components
- Parameters
- Filters
- Tables
- Graphs & Charts
- Insights
- Tab-based dashboards

---

## Embedded Reporting Flow

1. Reports are created and managed in **AWS QuickSight**
2. Dashboards are embedded into Angular using **Iframe**
3. Secure access is handled via **.NET API + AWS Lambda**
4. User permissions dynamically control visible data scope

---

## Report Clients
- High Schools
- Middle Schools
- District-level Administrators

**Primary Purpose:**  
Incident Management System Monitoring & Analytics

## Report Categories

### 1️⃣ Attendance & Access Management (Daily / Monthly / Yearly)
- Student attendance tracking
- Teacher & staff check-in / check-out reports
- Late arrival monitoring
- Student tardiness management enhancements

---

### 2️⃣ School Health & Disease Management (e.g., COVID)
- Vaccination status reporting
  - Vaccinated or not
  - Vaccination dates
- Facility-based exposure tracking
  - Logs all facilities used by infected individuals
- Aggregated statistics by:
  - School
  - District
  - Date range

---

### 3️⃣ District & School-Level Summary Reports
- Graph-based summary dashboards
- Data aggregation by:
  - Individual school
  - Entire district
- **Role-based visibility**
  - School users → Access only their school data
  - District officials → Access all schools data

---

## Authorization & Access Control
- Permission logic enforced at API level
- Embedded QuickSight dashboards respect user scope
- Supports multi-tenant educational environments

---

## Cost Optimization (Important)
- QuickSight charges **$0.50 per session**
- Implemented a **session caching system**
- Reduced redundant session creation
- Significantly lowered reporting costs

## Key Outcomes

- Significant reduction in QuickSight session cost
- High-performance report delivery
- Scales efficiently with user growth
- Maintains functional parity with interactive reports where needed

---

## Design Considerations

- Snapshot cache invalidation strategy (time-based or data-change-based)
- Secure snapshot access aligned with user permissions
- Clear separation between **public static** and **private dynamic** reports

---

This approach ensures **cost efficiency without sacrificing usability**, making QuickSight viable at scale for large educational districts.
